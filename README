üöÄ Publishing a New Update

Follow these steps when releasing a new version of the app.

1. Set environment variables

In PowerShell:

$env:TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY="this can be found in keys/myapp.key (this is the private key)"
$env:TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD="123"


‚ö†Ô∏è If you forget this step, the build won‚Äôt be signed correctly.

2. Build the app
yarn tauri build


(or cargo tauri build depending on your setup)

3. Generate latest.json

Run the script in the repo that updates the updater manifest:

yarn run generate-latest-json


This will produce/update the latest.json file.

4. Edit the notes field of latest.json

This can be formatted as markdown

5. Publish files to GitHub

Commit and push the new build files.

Upload the installer(s) (.exe, .sig, latest.json) and latest.json to your GitHub release.

6. Verify

Check that the new release is downloadable.

Ensure the updater in the app detects the new version and shows the release notes.
